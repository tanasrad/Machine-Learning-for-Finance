        "The simplest neural network is a logistic regressor. Logistic regression takes in values of any range but outputs only values between zero and one. There are many applications for logistic regressors. One example use case is to predict the likelihood of a homeowner to default on a mortgage. We might take all kinds of values into account to predict the likelihood of default, the debtorâ€™s salary, whether she has a car, the security of her job, etc., but the likelihood will always be a value between zero and one. Even the worst debtor ever cannot have a default likelihood above 100% and the best cannot go below 0%.\n",

In practice it is rarely the case that the function perfectly relates those values, so the machine quantifies this error with an additional term. Hence, the smaller that error term, the better is the function to explain the relationship between the $y$ and $x$. \n",
